# Phi-2 Journal Fine-tuning with QLoRA

This repository contains the code and instructions for fine-tuning the Phi-2 language model using QLoRA (Quantization-Based Low-Rank Adaptation) for generating journal entries based on personal notes.

## 1. Preparing Data

Before starting the fine-tuning process, ensure your data is formatted correctly. The dataset should consist of JSONL files containing input-output pairs or structured data suitable for training. Use the provided script to preprocess your data into the required format.

## 2. Set Up GPU Environment

Utilize a GPU environment for training the model efficiently. Instructions are provided for setting up the environment using Brev.dev, which offers GPU instances suitable for deep learning tasks.

## 3. Load Dataset

Load the training and evaluation datasets using the `datasets` library. Ensure the data is formatted properly and define a formatting function to structure training examples as prompts.

## 4. Load Base Model

Load the Phi-2 base model with 8-bit quantization enabled for memory-efficient training. This step initializes the model for fine-tuning.

## 5. Tokenization

Set up the tokenizer for tokenizing the input data. Define the maximum length for input tensors based on the distribution of dataset lengths. Tokenize the data with padding and truncation as necessary.

## 6. Set Up LoRA

Prepare the model for fine-tuning with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Configure the LoRA settings such as rank (`r`) and scaling factor (`alpha`) to control the number of parameters and emphasize new fine-tuned data.

## 7. Run Training

Initiate the training process using the configured model, datasets, and training arguments. Monitor the training progress, evaluate the model, and save checkpoints at specified intervals.

## 8. Try the Trained Model

Load the trained model from the best performing checkpoint directory. Test the model by providing sample prompts and generating journal entries based on the trained model's output.
